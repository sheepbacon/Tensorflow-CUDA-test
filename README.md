This Python code is to check whether your Python enviroment is availible for CUDA by tensorflow. This program aims for the tensorflow starter.

The tensorflow version is 2.1.

Make sure that you have already installed tensorflow-gpu with version 2.1 in your python environment, and your CUDA tool kit has ddl file called cusolver64_10.ddl.
If not, just rename the cusolver64_XX.ddl file to cusolver64_10.ddl.
You can mostly find out the ddl file in C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit\CUDA\v11.0\bin
